## Dogs-Vs-Cats CNN
**Goal of this model:**
To build and train a CNN that can accurately identify images of cats from those of Dogs.Moreover, fine-tune a **pretrained VGG16 model** and compare how efficient it is in making predictions from our sequential model that we'll build from scratch.

#### Obtaining The Data

For this model we'll use a random subset of the  Kaggle Dogs Versus Cats competition data set. Check it out at Kaggle website.
**Organizing The Data**
This will involve re-organizing the directory structure to hold the data set. Checkout how I finally organized the data in structure in this repo.


### Prerequisite
Before getting your hands on work consider having this pre-installation on your machine:
* Anaconda (*comes with Jupyter Notebook*)
* Python3.6 or higher version 
* Using Anaconda create an environment for Tensorflow CPU/GPU
* Have a modern web browser, preferably Chrome

**NOTE: Remember to activate your Anaconda environment inside the directory you'll be working from. After activating the environment, use conda to install relevant packages that you'll need.**
