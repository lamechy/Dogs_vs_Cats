## Dogs-Vs-Cats CNN
**Goal of this model:**
To build and train a CNN that can accurately identify images of cats from those of Dogs.Moreover, fine-tune a **pretrained VGG16 model** and compare how efficient it is in making predictions from our sequential model that we'll build from scratch.

#### Obtaining The Data

For this model we'll use a random subset of the  Kaggle Dogs Versus Cats competition data set. Check it out at Kaggle website.
